ClosestPairOfPoints
===================

Closest pair of points problem solved with the "Divide and Conquer" (D&amp;C) algorithm in Python 3.3.0, based on multi-branched recursion. The program for two-dimensional planar case works in O(n*(log(n)) time by using the recursive divide and conquer approach (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points_problem).
